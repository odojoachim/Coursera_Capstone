    "As a hospital director that plans resources you want to predict risk and severity of accidents on streets to help people that were victims of car accidents. As a head of police department you want to know how to protect citizens and patrol the streets so to limit dangerous behaviour on the streets. Aim of this project is to predict the severity of road accident so to limit the number of incidences on the way and optimize resources to protect victims. To understand this problem I will use Seatle incident data that uses metrics such as weather and road condition from 2004 to present. "
